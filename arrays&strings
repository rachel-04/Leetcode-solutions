## 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Soln:
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        # Initialize the result list to store merged characters
        merged = []
        
        # Get the length of the shorter word
        min_len = min(len(word1), len(word2))
        
        # Add alternating characters from both words up to the length of the shorter word
        for i in range(min_len):
            merged.append(word1[i])
            merged.append(word2[i])
        
        # Append the remaining part of the longer word, if any
        merged.append(word1[min_len:])
        merged.append(word2[min_len:])
        
        # Join the list into a single string and return
        return ''.join(merged)

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
word1 = "abc"
word2 = "defg"
print(solution.mergeAlternately(word1, word2))  # Output: "adbcef"
